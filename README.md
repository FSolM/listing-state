# Listing State
### A React PWA that allows you to see and upload property listings

You can catch the app at 

Favourites coming soon...

## Usage & Installation

Currently there's not a direct link to download the PWA, so visit the upper link and save the page to home

## Dev Environment

`IMPORTANT: Start Rails server first`

If you wanna test the app in a local environment:

Install the necessary Node packages

```
$ npm i
```
```
$ yarn install
```

Run the project

```
$ npm run start
```

If you have Rails already running (as you should), React tell you that the default port `3000` is already being occupied and will ask you if you wanna change it, just press `y`

The app should be visible in your network in the port `3001`
