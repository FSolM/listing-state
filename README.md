# Listing State

#### A React PWA that allows you to see and upload property listings

## About

This React project works as a template for a Property Listing application. It lets users upload new properties to a catalog, and allows for property browsing.

As mentioned earlier, this application must be taken as a template for a bigger project.

## Details

The applications comes with a `Ruby on Rails` API server counterpart that won't be listed here for security measures

You can catch the app here [Heroku](https://thawing-island-88859.herokuapp.com)

## Installation

Install this app as any React project.

### Dev Environment

**IMPORTANT: Start Rails server first**

If you wanna test the app in a local environment:

Install the necessary Node packages with the command

```
$ npm install
```

or

```
$ yarn install
```

To run the project execute

```
$ npm run start
```

If you have Rails already running (as you should), React tell you that the default port `3000` is already being occupied and will ask you if you wanna change it, just press `y`.

The app should be visible in your network in the port `3001`.
